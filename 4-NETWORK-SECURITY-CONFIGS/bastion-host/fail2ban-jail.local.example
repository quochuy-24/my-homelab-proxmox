# ===================================================================
# Example Fail2ban Custom Configuration (`jail.local`)
#
# Fail2ban was installed on the Bastion Host to automatically block
# IPs that attempt brute-force attacks.
#
# To customize Fail2ban, create this file at /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
# instead of editing the default jail.conf.
# ===================================================================

[DEFAULT]
# This section defines default parameters for all jails.

# Whitelist local and other trusted IPs to prevent accidental lockout.
# ignoreip = 127.0.0.1/8 ::1 <your_home_public_ip>

# Duration (in seconds) that an IP is banned. 1h = 1 hour.
bantime = 1h

# The time window (in seconds) during which failures are counted.
findtime = 10m

# The number of failed attempts before an IP is banned.
maxretry = 3

# --- SSHD Jail Configuration ---
# This section enables and configures the jail specifically for the SSH service.

[sshd]
# Enable this jail.
enabled = true

# You can override default settings for this specific jail if needed.
# For example, to be more strict with SSH:
# maxretry = 3
# bantime = 12h
